# Breast_Cancer
• The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is 
benign or malignant. 
• Aims to find independent features and to see general 
trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper 
parameter selection. 
• To achieve this I have used DECISION TREE 
CLASSIFIER to fit a function that can predict the 
discrete class of new input.
• TECH STACK: Jupyter Notebook, Python and its 
libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, pandas, 
Seaborn, sklearn.
